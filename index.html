            	<p>COPY IS FOR PLACEMENT ONLY--The City of Baltimore Department of Transportation (DOT) operates an Automated Traffic Violation Enforcement System (ATVES) program to enhance traffic safety on City roadways.The program also supports the Mayor's Mission Statement to "help grow Baltimore by 10,000 families in 10 years, we provide a safe and sustainable multi-modal transportation system."The ATVES program currently consists of two elements - an automated red light camera enforcement program and an automated speed camera enforcement program.</p>
                <p>The red light camera enforcement program is part of a comprehensive approach to intersection safety that incorporates engineering solutions, driver education, and enforcement countermeasures to improve intersection safety by helping to prevent red light running.  The objective of the red light camera enforcement program is to improve intersection safety by modifying aggressive driver behavior at intersections and reducing crashes caused by red light violations.</p>
                <p>The objective of the speed camera enforcement program is to improve safety in our school zones by modifying aggressive driver behavior and thereby reducing vehicular and pedestrian crashes and associated fatalities and injury severities. The ATVES program implements automated speed camera enforcement in addition to school zone speed limit signage to improve compliance with posted speed limits on city roadways within school zones where speed studies and citizen complaints indicate that a speeding problem exists.</p>
                <p>Speeding kills! It is a dangerous driver behavior in Baltimore City and throughout Maryland. From 2001-2010, excessive speeding caused one-third of all traffic fatalities in Maryland. Maryland suffered 154 speed-related fatalities in 2010 alone.  95% of those speed-related fatal accidents took place on urban roads. For communities, parents, and schools throughout Baltimore City concerned about excessive speeding in school zones, speed cameras provide an effective tool at slowing traffic and making roadways safe for all users of the road – drivers, passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians. Photo enforcement has a greater deterrent effect if drivers are aware it’s out there. Baltimore City wants to drivers to know that we are using photo enforcement.</p>
                <p>The ATVES program is successful since motorists have slowed down, so the program is effective as a vital public safety tool. Baltimore City first installed speed cameras in 2009. This was the only major change in traffic safety and enforcement in Baltimore over the last five (5) years. Between 2008 and 2011, annual traffic fatalities in Baltimore dropped from 49 to 26; and 2011 was the first year in a decade that traffic fatalities totaled less than 30.</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Traffic fatalities in the City are at their lowest level in a decade.</li>
                    <li>The average speed decreased at the City’s speed camera locations over a study period (program inception to March 2012).</li>
                    <li>Violations at fixed and portable speed cameras decreased by 75% over a study period (May 2010 to September 2011).</li>
                    <li>The City constantly gets requests from communities for speed cameras in their school zones.</li>
                    <li>Speed and red light cameras allow the police to focus officer staffing resources on other enforcement needs.</li>
                    <li>Speed cameras provide an excellent alternative to speed humps which cannot be provided on many urban streets.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Driver behavior is changing in Baltimore City as motorists are learning that they must obey traffic laws. The importance of the ATVES program is paramount since it helps keep our roadways safe and helps protect our children in school zones. DOT is taking special precautions, exercising best practices, and employing all resources needed to ensure the success of the City’s ATVES program.</p>
